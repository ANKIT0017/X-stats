Jul 28,"I Will only comment on what I know 
TCS is planning to remove 12000 people of mid / senior roles 
Scenario is that these mid/senior roles takes hefty salaries and everything gets paid by client company and some of them used to stay in bench for more than 2-3 years it is like getting paid to do nothing that's why they changed this rule that you can't stay without a project for more than 35 days (2 months time to get into a project)

The same TCS is planning to hire 42000 freshers bcz freshers  are now more skilled compared to older generation training Them won't be that much difficult with this AI era and they will pay peanuts to them in return but the same thing can't be done with the mid/senior roles 
Yes the market is in a bad situation but I have seen people with good skills they have got the job not only one many of them are bagging multiple offers 
If anyone says startups are not hiring then just see soham parek I don't want to say anything more than that",3,0,26,True,,,,29,[],[],[],186,False,False,False
